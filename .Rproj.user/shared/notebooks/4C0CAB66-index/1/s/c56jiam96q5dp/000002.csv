          'character.only' is 'FALSE' (default) or 'TRUE').

     pos: the position on the search list at which to attach the loaded
          namespace.  Can also be the name of a position on the curr"

 lib.loc: a character vector describing the location of R library trees
          to search through, or 'NULL'.  The default value of 'NULL'
          corresponds to all libraries currently known to
          '.libPaths()'.  Non-existent library trees are silently
          ignored.

character.only: a logical indicating whether 'package' or 'help' can be
          assumed to be character strings.

logical.return: logical.  If it is 'TRUE', 'FALSE' or 'TRUE'"
"1"," is
          returned to indicate success.

warn.conflicts: logical.  If 'TRUE', warnings are printed about
          'conflicts' from attaching the new package.  A conflict is a
          function masking a function, or a non-function masking a
          non-function.

 verbose: a logical.  If 'TRUE', additional diagnostics are printed.

 quietly: a logical.  If 'TRUE', no message confirming package

     'library(package)' and 'require(package)' both load the namespace
     of the package with name 'package' and attach it on the search
     list.  'require' is designed for use inside other functions; it
     returns 'FALSE' and gives a warning (rather than an error as
     'library()' does by default) if the package does not exist.  Both
     functions check and update the list of currently attached packages
     and do not reload a namespace which is already loaded. "
"1"," (If you
     want to reload such a package, call 'detach(unload = TRUE)' or
     'unloadNamespace' first.)  If you want to load a package without
     attaching it on the search list, see 'requireNamespace'.

     To suppress messages during the loading of packages use
     'suppressPackageStartupMessages': this will suppress all messages
     from R itself but not necessarily all those from package authors.

     If 'library' is called with no 'package' or 'help' argument, it
     lists all available pack"
"1","ages in the libraries specified by
     'lib.loc', and returns the corresponding information in an object
     of class '""libraryIQR""'.  (The structure of this class may change
     in future versions.)  Use '.packages(all = TRUE)' to obtain just
     the names of all available packages, and 'installed.packages()'
     for even more information.

     'library(help = somename)' computes basic information about the
     package 'somename', and returns this in an object of class
     '""packageInfo""'.  (The st"
"1","ructure of this class may change in
     future versions.)  When used with the default value ('NULL') for
     'lib.loc', the attached packages are searched before the
     libraries.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Normally 'library' returns (invisibly) the list of attached
     packages, but 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' if 'logical.return' is 'TRUE'.
     When called as 'library()' it returns an object of class
     '""libraryIQR""', and for 'library(help=)', one of class
     '""packageInfo""'.

     'require' returns (invisib"
"1","ly) a logical indicating whether the
     required package is available.

_L_i_c_e_n_s_e_s:

     Some packages have restrictive licenses, and there is a mechanism

     Free or Open Source Software (FOSS, e.g. <URL:
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS>) packages are determined by
     the same filters used by 'available.packages' but applied to just
     the current package, not its dependencies.

     'library' takes some further actions when package 'methods' is
     attached (as it is by default).  Packages may define formal
     generic functions as well as re-defining functions in other
     packages (notably 'base') to be generic, and this information is
     cached whenever such a namespace is loaded after 'methods' and
     re-defined functions (implicit generics) are excluded from the
     list of conflicts.  The caching and check "
"1","for conflicts require
     looking for a pattern of objects; the search may be avoided by
     defining an object '.noGenerics' (with any value) in the
     namespace.  Naturally, if the package _does_ have any such
     methods, this will prevent them from being used.

_N_o_t_e:

     'library' and 'require' can only load/attach an _installed_
     package, and this is detected by having a 'DESCRIPTION' file
     containing a 'Built:' field.

     Under Unix-alikes, the code checks that the package was"
"1"," installed
     under a similar operating system as given by 'R.version$platform'
     (the canonical name of the platform under which R was compiled),
     provided it contains compiled code.  Packages which do not contain
     compiled code can be shared between Unix-alikes, but not to other
     OSes because of potential problems with line endings and
     OS-specific help files.  If sub-architectures are used, the OS
     similarity is not checked since the OS used to build may differ
     (e.g. 'i386-p"
"1","c-linux-gnu' code can be built on an
     'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' OS).

     The package name given to 'library' and 'require' must match the

     case-insensitive file systems such as are common on Windows and
     macOS.
